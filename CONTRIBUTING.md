## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before cloning:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Node.js | 18.0.0+ | Backend + Frontend |
| npm | 9.0.0+ | Package manager |
| Rust | stable (latest) | Smart contracts |
| Docker + Docker Compose | 24.0+ | PostgreSQL + Redis |
| Git | any recent | Version control |

### Install Rust (if not installed)

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

### Install Stellar CLI

    cargo install --locked stellar-cli

---

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Jay-dev57/Xconfess.git
    cd Xconfess

### 2. Install dependencies

    npm install

This installs dependencies for all three workspaces:
- xconfess-backend - NestJS API
- xconfess-frontend - React frontend
- xconfess-contracts - Soroban smart contracts

### 3. Set up environment variables

    cp xconfess-backend/.env.example xconfess-backend/.env

Open xconfess-backend/.env and fill in the required values. At minimum:

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/xconfess
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

### 4. Start Docker services (PostgreSQL + Redis)

    docker compose up -d

Verify both services are healthy:

    docker compose ps

Both xconfess-postgres and xconfess-redis should show healthy.

### 5. Start the development server

    # Run backend + frontend together
    npm run dev

    # Or run separately
    npm run dev:backend
    npm run dev:frontend

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Always branch off main. Use this naming convention:

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | feat/short-description | feat/gdpr-export |
| Bug fix | fix/short-description | fix/token-expiry |
| Tests | test/short-description | test/audit-events |
| Docs | docs/short-description | docs/contributing |
| Refactor | refactor/short-description | refactor/auth-module |

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

### Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits format:

    <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
    [optional body]
    [optional footer]

Types: feat, fix, test, docs, refactor, chore, perf

Examples:

    feat(backend): add GDPR data export endpoint
    fix(contracts): correct token expiry calculation
    test(backend): add audit event unit tests
    docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md

Rules:
- Summary line under 72 characters
- Use present tense (add not added)
- Reference issues in footer: Closes #123

### PR Size Policy

- Ideal: under 400 lines changed
- Maximum: 800 lines changed
- If your change is larger, split it into multiple PRs

---

## Code Style

### Backend (TypeScript / NestJS)

    npm run backend:lint

Prettier config (xconfess-backend/.prettierrc): single quotes, trailing commas, 2-space indentation.

### Frontend (TypeScript / React)

    npm run frontend:lint

### Smart Contracts (Rust / Soroban)

    npm run contract:fmt
    npm run contract:fmt:check
    npm run contract:lint

All Rust code must pass rustfmt and clippy before submission.

---

## Testing Requirements

| Area | Command | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| Backend unit tests | npm run backend:test | Yes |
| Contract tests | npm run contract:test | Yes |
| Frontend tests | npm run frontend:test | Yes |
| Backend E2E tests | npm run backend:test:e2e | Optional |
| Contract integration | npm run contract:test:integration | Optional |
| Frontend smoke tests | npm run frontend:test:smoke | Optional |

Run all required tests at once:

    npm run test

Run the full CI check locally before opening a PR:

    npm run ci

All CI checks must pass before a PR will be reviewed.

---

## Wave / Drips Contribution Guidelines

Xconfess participates in the Stellar Wave grant program. If your contribution is tied to a Wave issue:

- Reference the Wave issue number in your PR description
- Keep each Wave contribution as a single focused PR — one issue, one PR
- Do not bundle multiple Wave issues into one PR
- Ensure your implementation matches the acceptance criteria listed in the issue exactly
- Add or update tests that validate the acceptance criteria

### Contribution checklist for Wave PRs

- Branch named after the feature area
- PR title references the feature area
- All acceptance criteria from the issue are met
- Tests cover the new behaviour
- No unrelated changes are bundled in
- npm run ci passes
