## Quick Validation Notes

- **Port Assumptions:** Backend on 5000, Frontend on 3000. Update URLs if running on different ports.
- **Database State:** Tests assume database is populated. If tests fail at step 3.1 or 4.1, ensure seed data exists or create test data via 3.3.
- **Authentication:** Tests assume cookie-based session auth. If using `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true`, some protected route tests may behave differently.
- **Admin Access:** To test 6.3 and 6.4, either:
  - Create an admin user in the database directly
  - Use a test admin account if available
  - Or skip if not applicable to current release
- **Real-Time Features:** WebSocket/reactions may require additional setup; basic submission/retrieval is sufficient for smoke test.
- **External Services:** Stellar contract calls, email delivery, and Stripe integration are NOT tested in this basic checklist. They are covered in integration tests.

## Test Execution Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured for both backend and frontend
- [ ] Docker infrastructure running (Postgres, Redis)
- [ ] Backend dev server started and healthchecks pass (sections 1.1–1.3)
- [ ] Frontend dev server started and loading (section 2.1)
- [ ] All API endpoints responding correctly (sections 1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1)
- [ ] All UI pages rendering without errors (sections 2, 3.2, 4.2, 6.4)
- [ ] Authentication flow working (login redirects, protected routes)
- [ ] Admin routes properly restricted (section 6.1–6.2 show failures as expected, 6.3 passes for admins)
- [ ] Evidence captured and organized
- [ ] No unexpected errors in browser console or server logs
- [ ] PR description updated with smoke test results

---

## Regression Test Pattern

To track regressions across releases, **capture baseline metrics on first pass:**

- Total confessions count at section 3.1
- Response times for each endpoint (useful for performance regression detection)
- Admin endpoint availability and response structure
- UI page load times (DevTools → Performance tab)

Compare these metrics in future smoke tests to detect degradation.
