# GrantFox Contributor Guide

This guide is the starting point for external contributors working on xConfess
GrantFox campaign issues. It ties together local setup, issue selection, branch
names, pull request linking, and validation commands.

## Campaign Labels

GrantFox campaign issues should include these labels:

- `Official Campaign`
- `GrantFox OSS`
- `Maybe Rewarded`

Before starting work, choose an open issue with the campaign labels, check that
it is not already assigned, and look for an existing pull request that mentions
the same issue number or title.

## Local Setup

Run these commands from a fresh clone of the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xconfess/Xconfess.git
cd Xconfess
npm install
```

Start the local infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
docker compose -f compose.yaml ps
```

Copy the local environment templates:

```bash
cp xconfess-backend/.env.example xconfess-backend/.env
cp xconfess-frontend/.env.example xconfess-frontend/.env.local
```

The example files are intentionally safe for local development. Do not commit
`.env` or `.env.local`, and do not paste private keys, tokens, passwords, or
production credentials into issues, pull requests, screenshots, or logs.

For a faster local UI workflow, you may add this value to
`xconfess-frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true
```

## Running The App

Run the full stack from the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run one service at a time:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```

Default local URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Live health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health/live`
- Readiness health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health/ready`
- Postgres: `localhost:55432`
- Redis: `localhost:6379`

## Branch Naming

Use a small, issue-focused branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b docs/grantfox-contributor-guide
git checkout -b fix/comment-search-proxy
git checkout -b test/wave-demo-journey-smoke
```

Keep each branch scoped to one issue. Avoid unrelated formatting, generated
files, dependency upgrades, or cleanup unless the issue explicitly asks for them.

## Validation Commands

Run the smallest relevant check while developing, then run the full CI command
before opening the pull request when practical.

```bash
# Backend only
npm run backend:build
npm run backend:lint
npm run backend:test

# Frontend only
npm run frontend:lint
npm run frontend:test
npm run frontend:build

# Contracts only
npm run contract:fmt:check
npm run contract:lint
npm run contract:test
npm run contract:build:release

# Full repository check
npm run ci
```

If a full check cannot run locally because a dependency, Docker service, or
platform tool is unavailable, document the failed command and the exact blocker
in the pull request body.

## Pull Request Checklist

Your pull request should include:

- A short summary of what changed.
- The validation commands you ran and their results.
- Screenshots for visible UI changes.
- Any known limitations or follow-up work.
- A closing keyword that links the GrantFox issue.

Use this format in the pull request body so GrantFox and GitHub can connect the
work to the issue:

```md
Closes #1118
```

Replace `1118` with the actual issue number you are solving. Do not omit the
closing keyword on GrantFox campaign PRs.

## Review Handoff

When the PR is ready, use the ready-for-review template:

- [Wave 5 ready-for-review template](WAVE_5_READY_FOR_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md)

If your PR includes logs or screenshots, follow the redaction rules:

- [Attaching logs to issues and PRs](LOG_ATTACHING_GUIDE.md)

Never include production secrets, private keys, real user data, or KYC/payment
information in repository artifacts.
