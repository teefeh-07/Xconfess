# ReactionsGateway Registration Fix #598

## Problem
The `ReactionsGateway` class existed in `src/reaction/reactions.gateway.ts` and was referenced by `WebSocketHealthController`, but it was never registered as a provider in any NestJS module. This meant:

- The `/reactions` WebSocket namespace was never instantiated at runtime
- Clients could not connect to the reactions websocket
- The `WebSocketHealthController` would fail when trying to inject `ReactionsGateway`
- Reaction broadcasts would never reach connected clients

## Solution
Registered `ReactionsGateway` in the `ReactionModule` providers array and exported it for use by other modules.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `src/reaction/reaction.module.ts`
- Added `ReactionsGateway` to the imports
- Added `ReactionsGateway` to the providers array
- Added `ReactionsGateway` to the exports array
- Added `WebSocketHealthController` to the controllers array

This ensures:
- NestJS instantiates the gateway at application startup
- The `/reactions` namespace is created and listening
- `WebSocketHealthController` can inject and use the gateway instance
- Other modules can import `ReactionModule` and use `ReactionsGateway`

#### 2. Created `src/reaction/reaction.module.spec.ts`
Unit tests that verify:
- `ReactionsGateway` is properly registered as a provider
- `WebSocketHealthController` can access the gateway instance
- The gateway has all required broadcast methods
- The module will fail to compile if the gateway is removed (regression protection)

#### 3. Created `test/reactions-gateway-boot.spec.ts`
Integration tests that verify:
- The `/reactions` namespace is live and accepting connections
- Clients can connect, subscribe, and receive broadcasts
- Rate limiting and connection management work correctly
- The gateway is properly wired into the application module graph

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd xconfess-backend
pnpm test reaction.module.spec.ts
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
cd xconfess-backend
pnpm test reactions-gateway-boot.spec.ts
```

### Run Existing E2E Tests
```bash
cd xconfess-backend
pnpm test reactions.gateway.spec.ts
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd xconfess-backend
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

2. Connect a WebSocket client to `http://localhost:3000/reactions`

3. Subscribe to a confession:
   ```javascript
   socket.emit('subscribe:confession', { confessionId: 'test-123' });
   ```

4. Verify you receive a `subscribed` event

5. Add a reaction via REST API and verify the `reaction:added` event is broadcast

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ The `/reactions` namespace is instantiated by Nest at runtime  
✅ Clients can connect, subscribe, and receive reaction broadcasts through the live gateway  
✅ Automated coverage fails if the gateway is dropped from module providers again  
✅ WebSocketHealthController can successfully inject and use ReactionsGateway  
✅ Reaction broadcast helpers work correctly after the wiring fix  

## Regression Protection

The new tests will fail if:
- `ReactionsGateway` is removed from `ReactionModule.providers`
- The gateway is not properly exported
- The WebSocket namespace is not initialized
- Subscription or broadcast functionality breaks

This ensures the issue cannot reoccur without tests catching it immediately.
